Que - 1]	How do you relate confirmed cases with deaths, recovered cases, active cases, testing rate and people hospitalized? Find the variations of all these attributes with respect to confirmed cases.

Inference:	We observe that Texas has large number of confirmed cases constituting about 17% to the total count, followed by other states.

* Find the relationship between confirmed cases and Death cases and find the details of state with highest number of Recovered cases recorded?

<br />
Inference:
	We can observe that even though confirmed cases are larger in California but maximum deaths are recorded in Newyork. There is no fixed pattern between these two attributes. So we can conclude that higher number of confirmed cases does not mean highest number of deaths recorded.
	So, we have a Pie chart for New York showing the relation between attributes. <br />

* Find the relationship between confirmed cases and Recovered cases and find the details of state with highest number of Recovered cases recorded?

  Inference : 	We can observe that even though confirmed cases are larger in California but maximum Recovered cases are recorded in Texas. There is no fixed pattern between these two attributes. So we can conclude that higher number of confirmed cases does not mean highest number of Recovered cases.
  So we have a plot for Texas showing the relation between attributes.

* Find the relationship between confirmed cases and Active cases and find the details of state with highest number of Active cases recorded?

Inference:
	We can observe that even though confirmed cases are larger in California but maximum Active cases are recorded in Newyork. There is no fixed pattern between these two attributes. So we can conclude that higher number of confirmed cases does not mean highest number of Active cases.
So we have a plot for Newyork showing the relation between attributes.

* Find the relationship between confirmed cases and testing rate and find the details of state with highest number of Active cases recorded?
  ![image](https://github.com/Vaishnavitorgal/Covid-Data-Analysis/assets/83570351/71ffaaec-22ac-4929-a267-1f74130fe66f)
  Inference:	We can observe that even though confirmed cases are larger in California but maximum testing rate are recorded in Newyork. There is no fixed pattern between these two attributes. So we can conclude that higher number of confirmed cases does not mean higher testing rate.
	So we have a plot for Newyork showing the relation between attributes.

* Find the relationship between confirmed cases and People Hospitalized and find the details of state with highest number of Active cases recorded?

  Inference:
	We can observe that even though confirmed cases are larger in California but maximum people hospitalized are recorded in Newyork. There is no fixed pattern between these two attributes. So we can conclude that higher number of confirmed cases does not mean higher people hospitalized.
	So we have a plot for Newyork showing the relation between attributes.

 Here after analyzing the question with different attributes, we found that there is no direct relationship between confirmed cases and other attributes.
	So it does not mean that highest number of confirmed cases leads to highest deaths, active, recovered cases, testing rate or people hospitalized. They are independent.
	But we have found out a hidden relationship from this analysis. We have found that deaths, active cases, testing rate and people hospitalized in state are related to each other. So we can conclude that more number of active cases means more number of deaths, more testing rate and more  people  hospitalized.

	With the increase in Incident rates, Testing rates are also increasing through the year.

 	The graph of incident rate is as similar to the graph of Testing rate.

Que - 2 ] Is there any decrease in Mortality ratio for the states lying under the most Covid affected territory?
![image](https://github.com/Vaishnavitorgal/Covid-Data-Analysis/assets/83570351/5abeef46-5b0a-41fd-8060-7e6089c8c96e)

Here from both the plots we could observe that the highest confirmed cases recorded and highest mortality ratio achieved is from the same territory United states.

Inference:
	In states like Connecticut, Michigan and New Hampshire, the mortality ratio has decreased in the year 2021.
	Other remaining states like New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, the mortality ratio has increased in the year 2021.

Conclusion : 
*There is no direct relationship between confirmed cases and other attributes (Active cases, Recovered cases, Death cases, People hospitalized and Testing rate).
*	Deaths, Active cases, Testing rate and People hospitalized in state are related to each other. We can conclude that more number of active cases means more number of deaths, more testing rate and more  people  hospitalized.
*	With the increase in Incident rates, Testing rates are also increasing through the year as they are positively correlated attributes.
*	The highest confirmed cases recorded and highest mortality ratio achieved is from the same territory United states.
*	New York City has highest Active case count in United States in the year 2020 whereas California has highest Active case count in the year 2021.
*	New York City also has highest count of People hospitalized, Deaths and Testing rate whereas California has highest confirmed cases.
